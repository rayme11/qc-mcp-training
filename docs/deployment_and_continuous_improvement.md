# Step 8: Deployment & Continuous Improvement

## Overview
This step focuses on deploying the agentic MCP solution and establishing a process for continuous improvement. Deployment ensures the solution is operational, while continuous improvement keeps it effective and relevant.

## Goals
- Deploy the agentic MCP solution in a real or simulated environment
- Monitor operation and collect feedback
- Iterate and enhance workflows, automation, and documentation

## Deployment Checklist
- Prepare environment (local, cloud, CI/CD)
- Configure input sources and output management
- Integrate agent with automation scripts and documentation
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Validate end-to-end workflow

## Continuous Improvement Process
1. Monitor agent operation and collect logs
2. Review traceability, coverage, and automation results
3. Gather feedback from users and stakeholders
4. Identify gaps, inefficiencies, or errors
5. Update requirements, contracts, tests, and automation
6. Document changes and improvements
7. Repeat regularly for ongoing enhancement

## Best Practices
- Use version control for all changes
- Automate deployment and monitoring where possible
- Schedule regular reviews and retrospectives
- Encourage feedback and collaboration
