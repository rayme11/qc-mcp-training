# Requirements Analysis

## Goal
Learn to extract and analyze requirements from public issue trackers (e.g., GitHub Issues) and understand how requirements drive API and test design.

## Steps
1. Identify a public API or open-source project with an issue tracker (e.g., GitHub).
2. Select a sample issue or feature request.
3. Document the requirements:
   - Summary
   - Description
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Related endpoints or features
4. Save your analysis in this file for traceability.

## Example
- **API:** [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- **Issue:** [GitHub Issue Example](https://github.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder/issues)
